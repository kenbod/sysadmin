# Ken's Notes on System Administration

This is a repo I created to keep track of system administration tasks and workflows for virtual machines running (currently) Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS. If I start managing machines that use a different OS, I will update this README appropriately.

# Recommended Order

If you attempt to use these notes to create a similar set-up, then I recommend the following rough order:

Using Volumes (if you need to format the file systems that your data nodes are going to use)
Install Java
Install Scala
Install HDFS
Install Spark
Install Hadoop (Optional; I ended up not using Hadoop, just HDFS.)
Using HDFS (to create the /user directory and a user account)

Use the commands in Misc as needed to create any non-spark, non-hdfs users that you need.

Questions and feedback on these instructions are welcome!
