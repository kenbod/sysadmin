# Instructions for Installing Hadoop

I decided to install the latest version of Hadoop. In July 2015, that was Hadoop 2.7.1.

## Downloading Hadoop

1. Head to &lt;http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html&gt;
2. Download the binary version of Hadoop: hadoop-2.7.1.tar.gz.
3. scp the archive to the VMs that need it.

## Installing Hadoop

**WARNING:** As you will see, installing Hadoop is NOT for the faint-hearted.
